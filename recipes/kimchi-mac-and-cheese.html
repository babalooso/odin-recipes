        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I cooked this super-gooey and spicy macaroni and cheese from Bon Appetit for myself during a lonely peak-pandemic Thanksgiving, and it made my day 10000x better. 
            Beware: it's rich and makes a ton, so if it's just you, or you and a partner/roommate, you'll probably have lots of leftovers. 
        (In this case, not a bad thing!)</p>
        
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 small butternut squash (about 1 1/4 pounds)</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                <li>1 cup Napa cabbage kimchi</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound elbow macaroni, shells, cavatappi, rigatoni, or other short pasta</li>
                <li>4 cups vegetable broth or water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal or 1/2 teaspoon Morton kosher salt (optional)</li>
                <li>1 pound sharp cheddar</li>
                <li>4 scallions</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel squash and cut flesh into 1/2" cubes. Peel and finely chop onion. 
                        Using the flat side of your knife, crush garlic clove, then peel and finely chop. Coarsely chop kimchi.
                        (Some kimchi juice is okay; no need to drain.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Add onion and cook,
                        stirring often, until softened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and kimchi and cook until
                        kimchi is starting to brown and stick to bottom of pot, about 5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add squash to pot and reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring halfway through, 
                        until squash is tender (a paring knife should pierce it easily), 6-8 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove lid and stir in pasta, along with vegetable stock or water. If using water,
                        add salt. Cover and bring to a simmer; cook until pasta is al dente and most of the stock is absorbed (you want some starchy liquid left 
                        in pan), 6-8 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, grate sharp cheddar on large holes of a box grater. Trim and finely slice scallions.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low and add cheese to pot; stir until cheese is melted and gooey, about 2 minutes. 
                        Season mac and cheese with a few grinds of freshly ground black pepper and scatter scallions over.
                    </li>
                </ol>
